EID 101 Assignment for Ethics Lecture

A week from today, on October 6th, I [Dean Shay] will give a lecture to all EID 101 students in Rose Auditorium during your normal EID 101 meeting time, 5-5:50PM. There are 3 learning objectives:

- Inform (or reinforce, if you have already discussed this) that engineers have an obligation to their clients and all of society to develop ethical devices and systems.
- Develop your understanding that you, the engineer, must consider the ethical implications of your designs (not leave this up to a consultant), which should be examined early in the design process.
- Familiarize you with the codes of ethics of your professional societies (ACM, AIChE, ACSE, ASME, IEEE).

Students often believe that computer systems are less biased (or more correct) than humans, I would like each of you to complete the attached assignment. Your challenge is to design an algorithm (either a computer program, or do it manually or semi-automated in Excel) to compare a list of vehicle speeds to a list of speed limits and determine how many traffic tickets should be issued. See the attached PDF for more details. The CSV files contain the data. Answer the questions in the linked form (see PDF) before class on Monday, 10/6.
